# balionis-aws8

This sandbox is to remind me how to do 1) web (with amplify + s3) , 2) cognito (for authentication) and 3) kotlin lambda (for backend).

The source for above is https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/hands-on/build-serverless-web-app-lambda-apigateway-s3-dynamodb-cognito/ 
except setup is done via "aws cli" rather "aws console".
